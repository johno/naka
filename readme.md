A minimalist front end framework.

#### How is `naka` different?

Naka seeks to blend the best parts of popular front end frameworks while remaining opinionated and minimal.

#### What does `naka` offer?

- an ergonomic cli
- an emphasis on testing
- a miniscule footprint
- global state that is easy
- universal rendering
- pluggable api

#### Where'd the name come from?

When writing this readme, I randomly opened Iterating Grace to look for name inspiration.
I happened on the page listing Koons Crooks' list of prior companies.
One was named naka.
It was short, sweet, and was a nice word in other languages.
Naka also happens to be pleasant to type.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g naka
```
